# react-treeview-simple
tree view for React

## Overall
When I deal with hierarchical data, I want a treeview to show the data. This treeview component will allow you to rerender the nodes on the tree. It could go with whatever UI library. For example, Material-UI or Bootstrap.

## installation

```
npm install --save react-treeview-simple
```
